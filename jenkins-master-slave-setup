installation of jenkins 

on ec2 choose ubuntu 
 1. install java first 
 2. sudo apt-get update
 3. sudo apt install jdk 
 4. clone jenkins repo from jenkins.io
 5. sudo apt install jenkins
 6. sudo systemctl status jenkins
 7. systemctl restart jenkins

to connect master and slave in jenkins
 -> install jdk and jenkins on both of them.
 -> follow below commands 
   1. sudo vim /ect/passwd --> check for jenkins -> in this we fine :/bin/false change this to :/bin/bash
       check jenkins user and do below command
   2. sudo passwd jenkins  -> create password for jenkins
     -> provide root privilages to jenkins user by using "vi sudo --> i(insert mode) --> do yyp (to copy paste) amd add jenkins after root 
	 -> and mention Nopasword in 3rd row 
   3. vim /etc/ssh/sshd-config  --> search for password authentication and make it to yes
     -> after making changes in sshd restart the service by "systemctl restart sshd"
															 systemctl status sshd-config

  do login to the slae and do 
   -> sudo apt-get update 
   -> add jenkins user & create password (user add Jenkins)
   -> provide root privilages to jenkins user by ..>  vi sudo --> yyp --> i (insertmode) add jenkins 
   -> do vim /etc/ssh/sshd-config   -> pasword authentication:yes
    systemctl restart sshd and status sshd
	
 now go to master server 
  > switch to jenkins user by sudo -jenkins
  > to connect master with slave we need to generate ssh key 
   -> ssh-key gen   --> copy or go to the path provided
   -> ssh copy-id Jenkins(user)@localhost -> yes -> provide jenkins paswrd ->in o/p check how to connect to connect hostname:
   -> for connecting to slve use this command 
     -> ssh-copy-id Jenkins@slavepublic ip
	  asks password provide jenkins password --> copy command we can connect from master to slave for checking "hostname -i" shows slave ip'search
	  
  Repeat the task from slave to connect to master from above 
  
  now we can use our master slave architechture; in the same format we can connect multiple number of slaves like this
