create an ec2 instance --> add default security inbound rules with ssh,http,https
  select default vpc, and subnet should be enabled to public and create security group and add http,https 

create a rds db 
  select Mysql --> freetier --> select the credentials --> donot connect with ec2 --> public access no (if we are using mysql workbench then we need to select public access)
  create new security rule --> us-east-1a --> then create
  
  now login to ec2 instance 
  and change to root or use sudo for packages 
  
  apt update
  apt install apache2
  apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql --> for installaing mysql and php and libapache2-mod-php
  cd /var/www/html/
   check with public ip we can see apache page
   create index.php 
    <?php
	   echo"asslamualikum"
	?>
	
	move html to backup 

 now check connectivity with rds by using telnet <endpoint id> 3306 --> unable to connect
  so now goto rds --> securitygroup --> inboundrules --> edit and add a rule --> mysql/aurora copy the security group details of ec2(best practice)
check again telnet

now install mysql client --> to connect to rds mysqlclinet is required 

apt install mysql-clinet
php -v for checking version

goto aws documentation "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateWebServer.html"

create db.inc.php and copy from above page and mention the db details like rds, username,paswd, dbname 
after this create the db manually by login to rds by 
 mysql -u username -h rdsid -p

show databases;
create database php;

from the above doc copy the samplePage.php 
just check in the server by public_ip/samplePage.php 

now in the file add the path of db.inc.php


if we have domain name then do this 

goto /etc/apache2/sites-available/  -->create vi php.<domainname>.conf 

after adding conf file 

link tis by 
cd etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/conf file name  by this linking it will read the conf file other wise it wont know this 
apachectl -t  -> shows directory error
mkdir /var/log/apache2/php/
now againg apachectl -t  -> shows syntax ok 

for checjing public ip in use 
curl ifconfig.me
